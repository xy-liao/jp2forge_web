[![Version: 0.1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/xy-liao/jp2forge_web/releases/tag/v0.1.2)

A web interface for the JP2Forge JPEG2000 conversion library, providing an easy-to-use system for converting and managing image files in the JPEG2000 format.

**Important Note**: This application serves primarily as a promotional demonstration for the [JP2Forge script](https://github.com/xy-liao/jp2forge) and its BnF (Biblioth√®que nationale de France) compliance capabilities. JP2Forge Web doesn't leverage all available arguments and features of the underlying JP2Forge script - it's a case study implementation showcasing selected functionality of the more comprehensive JP2Forge tool.

**Documentation**: All documentation is located in the [docs folder](docs/). For an overview of available documentation, see the [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) file.
