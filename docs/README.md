# JP2Forge Web Application Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the **JP2Forge Web** application, which provides a web-based interface for the JP2Forge JPEG2000 conversion tool.

## About JP2Forge Web

JP2Forge Web is a Django-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for converting various image formats to JPEG2000. It serves as a promotional demonstration for the JP2Forge script, focusing particularly on BnF (Biblioth√®que nationale de France) compliance standards. This application showcases a subset of JP2Forge's capabilities rather than leveraging all available arguments of the underlying script. It's intended as a case study implementation that demonstrates how the JP2Forge script can be integrated into a web-based workflow.

Key aspects of this demonstration implementation include:
- User authentication and job management
- Batch image conversion
- Selected compression modes including BnF compliance
- Job status tracking and notifications
- Downloadable converted files
