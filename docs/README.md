## About JP2Forge Web

JP2Forge Web is a Django-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for converting various image formats to JPEG2000. It serves as a promotional demonstration for the JP2Forge script, focusing particularly on BnF (Biblioth√®que nationale de France) compliance standards. This application showcases a subset of JP2Forge's capabilities rather than leveraging all available arguments of the underlying script. It's intended as a case study implementation that demonstrates how the JP2Forge script can be integrated into a web-based workflow.

Key aspects of this demonstration implementation include:
- User authentication and job management
- Batch image conversion
- Selected compression modes including BnF compliance
- Job status tracking and notifications
- Downloadable converted files

## Relationship to JP2Forge Core

This documentation covers only the web application interface. For documentation on the underlying JP2Forge core conversion scripts and their parameters, please refer to the separate [JP2Forge repository](https://github.com/xy-liao/jp2forge).
